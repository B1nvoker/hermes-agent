"""A messaging conversation its chat moved past stays usable from the apps (Teknium's ruling).

When a messaging chat names another conversation (``/new``, ``/resume``, ``/branch``, a handoff,
its next inbound naming another one), a Desktop / Webapp / mobile view still open on the previous
conversation keeps working: its turns, Stop and controls act on that conversation alone, and its
replies reach its viewers only, never the chat, which now gets only its new conversation's replies.

``detach`` moves the live session off the chat's route onto a key that names the conversation
(``agent:<ns>:detached:<session id>``) and pins that key on a copy of its source
(``SessionSource.detached_route``). From there the turn runs on the ordinary messaging path:

* ``build_session_key`` answers the pinned key, so the runner's per-route state (running slot,
  agent cache, busy guard, the agent a Stop reaches) is the conversation's own, never the chat's;
* ``SessionStore.get_or_create_session`` resolves the key to the conversation itself
  (``detached_entry``), and never creates or persists a route for it;
* delivery goes through the profile's ``LocalSessionAdapter`` (gateway/session_local.py), as a local
  session's does: its sends publish nothing, viewers read the canonical event stream.

The key carries no platform slot, so a reader that parses a chat out of a session key
(``gateway.run._parse_session_key``) finds none and delivers nowhere. The chat naming the
conversation again (``/resume``) moves it back onto the chat's route (``SessionAuthority.name_lane``).
